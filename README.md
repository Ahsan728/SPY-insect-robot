# SPY-insect-robot
Our project is a four-legged mobile robot with intelligent sensing and decision-making capabilities. Multiple sensors with embedded knowledge bases and learning capabilities are used in a novel approach towards environmental perception and reaction. These sensors continuously monitor the environment as well as their own operating parameters. Intelligent sensing is shown to be the key towards a high degree of autonomy for a mobile robot. It has a total of 5 servo motors on its four legs. It can walk and turn, and also can sense the obstacle distance around it. It responds to light, based on prevailing environmental conditions.
